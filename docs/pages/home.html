<h3>Github Blog for Team4 - Graph Coloring Project</h3>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p>This <a href="https://github.com/hanglearning/662finalProject_18f">repository</a> is for our CISC662 final project Graph Coloring problem in 2018 Fall Semester at the University of Delaware.</p>

	<p>It contains our modified code we borrowed from https://github.com/bhandaresagar/graph-coloring-radio-problem and https://github.com/brrcrites/graph-coloring and our automation script as a benchmark tool to present the testing results of the performance of a machine running on these algorithms.</p>

	<p>Thanks to our team members Rongxuan Hu, Yueran Zhang and Hang Chen! We together made this project done!</p>

	<p>This github blog is inspired by our instructor, Dr. Sunita.</p>
