<h4 class="card-title">Usage</h4>
<p>After you unzip or git clone the repository, run test.py directory in the top directory.</p>

<p style="color:red;">This project requires python2.7, python3.6 and cmake</p>

<pre><code>$ python3.6 test.py</code></pre>

<p>As previously mentioned, 7 map choices will be provided. The program will automatically run through each algorithm one by one, and output the running time for each algorithm in your console.</p>

<p>Our steps of using this program and finished this project was -</p>
<ol>
	<li>Made a google sheet, listing our testing platforms one by one.</li>
	<li>Listed the 6 pre-built maps under those platforms.</li>
	<li>Listed the 7 alforithms under those maps.</li>
	<li>Run the program on each machine, and test each of the 6 pre-built maps one by one, and record the running time on the sheet.</li>
	<li>Made bar graphs on the google sheet to get a clear idea of the comparison results.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those steps also form the only recommended way by us to run this benchmark suite.</p>
